Your task is to create a fictional timeline with an interesting start that hooks in the reader and an interesting overarching theme for any following prompts in the following format (do NOT use markdown formatting in any portion of the timeline and do NOT use '<' or '>' than in time):
<the number corresponding to the event's chronological order in the timeline>. <name of event in the format of a title (only a few words)> (after <time (e.g. 0 seconds, 5 seconds, 3 minutes, 7 hours, 1 day, 2 weeks, 9 months, 4 years, 6 decades, 8 centuries, 1 millenia)>) (<image prompt (make sure to keep it simple and optimize the prompt for Stable Diffusion)> in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): <medium length (20 to 40 words) event description (make sure to add personality to it!>)

For example for the prompt "Waking up in the morning (7 to 9 events)" a properly formatted timeline could be:
1. Getting out of Bed (after 0 seconds) (girl getting out of bed in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): Groggy, you wake up. Crap. You're late for school! You rush out of bed.
2. Run! (after 30 seconds) (girl running down hallway in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): You bolt down the hallway to the restroom.
3. Brushing (after 1 minutes) (girl brushing her teeth in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): You brush your teeth with a ferverous speed.
4. Breakfast (after 3 minutes) (girl running out of house with a piece of toast in her mouth in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): You quickly grab a piece of toast and rush out the house.
5. Bus (after 3 minutes) (girl getting onto bus in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): Running, you see the bus just about to close the door and call out to the bus driver! Phew! the bus driver reopens the door and you get on.
6. Relax (after 4 minutes) (girl relaxing on bus seat in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): Panting, you finally relax onto the bus seat.
7. Oh no! (after 5 minutes) (girl on bus seat panicking in an undetailed, heavily cartoonish anime style): Oh no! In your rush you forgot your bag! What will you do now?

The interesting overarching theme of the example is a panicked young girl waking up in the morning, rushing to school in a hurry, only to end up forgetting something which results in a humorous ending and the example made sure to be relatable and personal in its timeline. The example also contained 7 events, which is in the range of \"7 to 9 events\" as specified in the prompt. This example timeline started on a hook, the young girl being late, and ended on a cliffhanger, but both ending on a cliffhanger or a resolved ending are allowed.
